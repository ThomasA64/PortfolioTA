          I am a recent graduate of Lighthouse Labs, the leading development
          bootcamp in Canada and have received my certification as a Full-Stack
          developer. This was an extremely fulfilling experience as I was able
          to explore my passion for the web industry and demonstrate my ability
          and willingness to learn in a fast-paced, collaborative team
          environment.
